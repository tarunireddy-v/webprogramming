                <strong>Born and brought up in Kolkata</strong>, I spent my childhood immersed in the city's rich culture, vibrant energy, and incredible food, which greatly shaped my interests and personality. I have always been passionate about <em>Bharatanatyam</em>, a classical dance form I've practiced since childhood, as well as <em>swimming</em> and <em>basketball</em>, which keep me active and disciplined. Traveling is another joy in my life, allowing me to explore diverse cultures and broaden my perspective. Recently, I moved to <strong>Hyderabad</strong>, my parents' hometown, after completing high school, and I find it fascinating to connect with my roots in a new way.

                These personal experiences have influenced my approach to life and learning, which I now bring to my academic journey as a computer science student at <strong>VIT Vellore</strong>. With a strong dedication to my studies, I achieved over <em>90%</em> in both my 10th and 12th board exams and embraced leadership roles in school as a junior and senior prefect. Alongside academics, I received a character award for my integrity and actively participated in literary, cultural, and sporting events. Music and storytelling also inspire me; I enjoy listening to artists like <strong>Gracie Abrams</strong>, <strong>The Weeknd</strong>, and <strong>The Neighbourhood</strong> and watching shows like <strong>Friends</strong>, <strong>Gilmore Girls</strong>, <strong>Stranger Things</strong>, <strong>Suits</strong>, and <strong>Dark</strong>.

                Looking ahead, I aspire to grow both personally and professionally by exploring opportunities that challenge and inspire me. Whether it's advancing my expertise in computer science, traveling to discover new perspectives, or enjoying life's simpler joys like food and music, I aim to maintain a well-rounded and fulfilling lifestyle. For me, success lies in learning, evolving, and staying true to the passions that make life meaningful.
